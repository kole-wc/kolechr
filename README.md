👋 Hi, I’m @kolechr (Wanthongchai "Kole" Chaicharee)
👀 I’m interested in anything programming related and love to develop.
🌱 I graduated with BBA degree in MIS, I'm committed to learn, build, contribute to fill skills gap that I'm missing.
💞️ I’m looking forward to collaborate with the world towards the greater good!
